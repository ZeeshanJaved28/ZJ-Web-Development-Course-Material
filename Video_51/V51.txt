Exercise 8: Solution

Guys, in exercise 8, I gave you a bounce animation. Many of you made it, some made it wrong.

Now we have to make this ball bounce once like this and once like this now we will put two animations.

animation: animateX 3s linear infinite,
           animateY 1s ease-out infinite alternate;

@keyframes animateX {
        from {
          left: 0;
        }
        to {
          left: 100%;
        }
      }
      @keyframes animateY {
        from {
          bottom: 0;
        }
        to {
          bottom: 100%;
        }
      }
