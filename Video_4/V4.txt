In this video I learn heading <h> , paragraph <p> and anchor <a> tags.
And also we make a bookmark website.
This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites in one place.


we talked about the basic structure,
we said that it tells that this is an HTML page
HTML lang is equal to en
lang is an attribute and its value is en
this page's content is in English
this tells the search engines
or if anyone is sitting with the link of this web page
then he will know that this web page is in English
he can parse this web page according to that
the browser will also know
that your web page is in English


heading level 1 <h1></h1> -> Major heading
heading level 2 <h2></h2> -> Sub heading 
Shortcut:
alt+shift+down cursor -> replicate
right mouse click + press hold alt key

wherever i click, i will get multiple cursors
then whatever i type will come in multiple cursors
wherever there are cursors, whatever I type will be visible

h6 is more than enough
In HTML, headings have been put up to h6
You will never need h7

Shortcut:
lorem(n) -> dummy paragraph in VS-code through Emmet  ; n=7,10,23,...100,...

Now let's talk about what are the attributes in HTML.
These are the attributes in HTML.
Like I used the HTML tag,
lang is equal to en,
lang is an attribute.
We did not use any attribute in the body.
We did not use any attribute in H1.
We did not use any attribute in P.
But I can use a style attribute in P,
which is also called inline CSS, if I make the background color red
ok, like this, so its background color will be red
this is called inline CSS through style attribute
so if you put style is equal to CSS
first we learned to put CSS here, but if you put style is equal to
so you will get this background red here, let will show you, you got this red background, okay.

so I can also put style inline, but when you make industry level websites,
we use inline styles very less because the maintainability decreases,
reusability decreases, okay.

style is an attribute in the p tag
rel and href is an attribute of link tag

Create a Comment in VSCode, the easy way.
You'll use this mainly to add information to the flow of your program that will help your future-self and your colleagues understand what's going on.

First, place your cursor where you'd like to add the comment. Then, use the VS Code comment shortcut that corresponds to your platform below.

On Windows, the shortcut is: CTRL + /
On Mac, the shortcut is: Command + /
The VSCode comment shortcut Mac is very similar to the Windows version.

here you can see ahref is equal to open google
this is called anchor tag which helps us to make links
you must have seen many such links

Shortcut:
Now I tell you one more thing
That here if we want it to open in a new tab,
Like I am clicking on it, it is opening in the same tab,
If you want to open it in a new tab, then you have two ways,
Either you can click on the mouse wheel,
Now I will tell you another way, if you want to open it in a new tab,
Then you can use an attribute,
You can write here that target is equal to
underscore blank and VS code gives you suggestions
so I wrote it by hitting two enter
if you write in notepad or in any other
cheap editor then what happens to you
means according to quality, cheap
free is also VS code but according to quality
if you use a cheap editor
then target is equal to underscore
blank you have to type it completely, it is a little painful
but if you write it in any way
and what will happen now
now I will click on it
I am clicking
I am not clicking the mouse wheel
I am clicking
I will click
it came to the new tab
ok
I will click the mouse wheel
then also it will open in the new tab

Shortcut:
I will press shift and right arrow key
and then press control x, then press end key, all the cursors will go to end
Because if you press end key on one cursor, then it goes to end, and then I will do ctrl v
