Semantic Tags are for browsers and weblers who want to understand your website properly. They tell them what is the content of your website and what is the purpose of which place and which tag If you don't use semantic tags in HTML, then your work will be done It's not that if you don't use semantic tags, then your website won't look good. You can do good designing. But we want to explain to Google and Bing search engines about our website. And if we explain them about our website, then they will be able to understand our website. And they will rank our website on Google, Bing, and on the respective search engines. And we want the crawlers can understand our website and we want that whoever wants to understand our website they can understand it well that's why there are some special tags like header, nav, main, article, figure
all these special tags are made in html which help you to structure your website now if there is something in the header then I know that it is a header that is, it is at the top if there is something in the header, then I know that it is a header, that is, it is at the top. If there is something in the footer, then I will understand that the website has started ending from here, this footer has started here. This footer could have been div, but no, if I am using semantic HTML, then I will use the footer tag. Along with that, where I was making my navigation bar in the span tag, this time I will not make my navigation bar in the span tag, I will make my navigation bar in the span tag, this time I will not make my navigation bar in span tag, I will make my navigation bar in nav tag. So these kinds of differences explain our search engines very well about what our website is about.
