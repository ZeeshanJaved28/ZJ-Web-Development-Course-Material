CSS Media Queries

There was a time when you were making a website for a client, then you had to specifically tell that client that I have to make my website responsive. But today, by default, if anyone makes a website from you, then you have to make it responsive. This is the default setting. The most important thing for responsiveness is media query for which you have to write some additional code and your website that looks good and your desktop will look good To make your website look good on mobile you have to use media queries which are very simple and have a straight forward syntax.

CSS2 --> Media rule
CSS3 --> Media Query

I have come to tell you tell you that you can change your styles on the basis of which device you are using I will tell you a story I will tell you a story like grandfathers tell their grandchildren I don't know about my time but when CSS2 came then a query named media was introduced and its purpose was only that the media query used to tell that if any person is accessing the website in any other device then the styles can be changed that was the only purpose it was called media rule which was introduced in CSS2 and in CSS3 the name of this media rule was changed to media query so how did media rule work in CSS2 forget that I will tell you how media query so in CSS 2, how the media rule worked, forget that, in CSS 3 I will tell you how the media query works so in CSS 3 what is the syntax of media query that first of all you do that you write at the rate media it means that you are writing a media query after this, in which device you want to write media query, you tell this and before that, a not or only comes that is, I can write here media only screen that is, it will be applied only when it is on the screen so a typical syntax of media query looks like this media not or only we write that either don't show it on this media type or only if it is of this media type, then show and after that we write some expressions here about which I will tell you and write CSS code in it which will be applied when this thing will be satisfied, okay, now I will tell you how you can use it.

when this thing will be satisfied, okay, now I will tell you how you can use it so here I will write media, in most of the cases we write only because we want that only this media is a match when we are on the screen when the media type is screen and what are the other media types, you can put all means all media types, then you can put print if the website is being viewed on the printer, then you will see it there is another media type, screen, which is the most common in the phone, laptop or in your iPad if you are showing, then it is screen, there is another speech devices, which are used for those people who cannot see so here speech is added if you want this CSS style to be applied only when there is a speech device then you will write speech here, but in most of the cases you will write screen here and after that you will write end here and you will write a condition like this

let's say I write max width should be 455 pixels and let's say I want to make the background color red so I will do one thing, I will write body and inside body I will write background color blue ok, here I will make background color blue so if max width is 45 pixels then background color will be blue so I will show you what it means I will make it smaller and smaller here you can see the width I will make it smaller and smaller now you see if its max width is I will make it smaller, I will% media query as I told you till now, this is it, this is the syntax you will find yourself

applying this syntax in 90 to 95% of the cases media only screen and max width 455 or whatever max width, I can also give min width here, if I make it min width then what will happen, if I made it min width then it will apply after how many pixels I gave I gave 455 pixels now you can see here that media query is enabled because the width is more than 455 pixels if I reduce it, so the media query is gone it is gone from here, it means that the media query is not present all these CSS styles will not be applied, so this media query is not visible as soon as I increase it, it says of media query these css styles will not be used so this media query is not visible as soon as I will increase it it is saying that media query is activated so these styles will not work that's all about media query so to summarize media query is used to make responsive designs.

div.boxes>div.box*3

For example:
let us say I have two boxes I make two boxes here and I will do div.boxes and here I will do div.box and I will do div.boxes and here I will do div.box and I will put some more boxes here in dot box I will say that the dot box I want to keep its width let us say 344 pixels and I want to keep its height

let us say 344 pixels by the way why I have chosen 344 pixels only for this example if you have any idea then tell me which Isaac Newton brain of I have that I used 344 pixels only

Why didn't I do 392, you must tell me in the comment section below if you know and you see here that I have only given the width of the box so far

I also give its background color and I give its background color let us say steel blue okay, I gave's background color steel blue you'll get to see these boxes

I'll also give padding and margin so if I give padding 3 pixels and margin 3 pixels so you can see that after giving padding and margin it looks like this

now suppose I want that these boxes as they are visible I want these boxes to look like this on small screens that they start wrapping themselves or let's say I want to see these boxes on small screens to make it look like it is wrapping itself

Let's say I want this to be a flex box I know I haven't told you about flex box yet I am just giving you an example Don't worry, I will tell you about flex box in detail But just understand that by putting display flex it will come in this kind of container now if I make it small, you see it is getting small like this, so I can say that when I am making it small

let us say when this red break point is coming, 388 pixels is coming so I will say that the flex direction of this should be column this is just an example that I am giving you this is not the best way to do this I will tell you, I will say that I am giving you this is not the best way to do this I will tell you I will say about boxes that what should I do about flex direction flex direction column so what will happen by doing this as soon as I will make it small now see I did this I will make it oops I have actually made a mistake here I will make it max width not min width, I will make it max width I will not make it min width now see you guys it is looking like this now as soon as width Now you can see, it looks like this

Now as it will be small You can see it came like this So what can I say This phone, that is, the devices smaller than this Whichever number I gave here 400 something, smaller than 455 pixels Apply this CSS in them

Now what happens is when you are doing responsive design So you guys understand the concept of break points we break our website in 2-3 break points we say that the phone devices should be below 455 pixels this is an arbitrary number you can take a good approximation of this number but I am telling you an example devices bigger than 455 pixels

let us say from 455 to 750 we consider them as tablets that they will be like tablets somewhere and we will apply some more styles in them, then the devices above that, let's say up to 1080 pixels, we will say that 1920 or whatever pixels are our widescreen, up to that, a particular style will be applied, then there are some ultra wide monitors, whose width is very high, in those also we want to show our website in a different way so in those ultra wide monitors we can decorate our website with some more media queries we can style it so i hope you understood media query.

now i will use media query when we will make projects and i will use media query a lot whenever you are writing raw css you will use media query a lot, whenever you are writing raw CSS you will use media query if you are using frameworks, then while using frameworks, you will not use media query because frameworks is behind the hood, like tailwind CSS behind the hood uses media queries bootstrap is behind the hood uses media query, but raw CSS we will write, we will make projects in raw CSS you will see there

How I will use media query

Before going i want to show you one more thing that there is a media query which you guys use i will write here and and i will write orientation orientation let's say i will say landscape when our orientation is landscape then let's say i want to color background purple ok whose background color I want to color background purple whose background color I want to make purple body, let's say I want to do something like this

let's say I want to color body purple, not background I will make color purple so I made body color purple when I made purple, I didn't write anything here in fact let's do one thing, let's put border in body 2 pixels solid purple I have not written anything here, in fact I will do one thing, I will put a border in the body, 2 pixels solid purple, ok, I have done this, now see here you are getting to see 2 pixels solid purple, you are getting to see this when my orientation is landscape, but if my orientation is portrait from landscape, now see it will disappear, what is the meaning of portrait? portrait means that the height, this height is portrait this height is more than width and if width is more than height then it is landscape so if it is landscape then this border is visible so you can also do orientation landscape or portrait here so if I have made portrait here then this line will be visible in portrait you can see that this border is visible only in portrait so if you want your styles to be enabled in landscape or portrait then you can use this, this media query is also very popular but I am telling you again, most of the cases you will find yourself using this type of media query.
