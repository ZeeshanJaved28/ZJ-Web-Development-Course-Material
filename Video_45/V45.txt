CSS Transition Property:

Let's say I have a website and there is a sidebar on it. Let's say I click on a button and the sidebar comes out from the left side. You tell me yourself that the sidebar will look good coming from this side or from this side. The smooth transition you just saw on your screen is made with the help of transition property in CSS. That is, we say that there should be a very smooth transition from one property to another transition so that it looks appealing to the eyes.

Now what is this transition? First of all, I will tell you this because if you don't know what transition is, then you will not be able to understand this property so well Transition means going from one state to another state very smoothly So what happens in CSS transition? It is exactly the same thing that going from one state to it will go smoothly so what happens in CSS transition? it goes smoothly from one state to another.

Now the transition property is made up of 4 properties never learn transition property directly, learn 4 properties first of all, transition property what is transition property what is transition property then transition timing function transition duration transition timing function transition timing function and then transition delay so these 4 functions you can learn, which property i want to transition, transform property how much duration, 3 seconds what will be the function, ease in and ease out, there are many options if you do like this, you will get many functions i will tell you what is the meaning of this, but for now we will do ease in ease in out, ease in and what is the difference of ease out.

I will tell you and transition delay I say that I want it after 4 seconds I want it after at least 1 second I will explain all the four properties in which property transition should be applied first of all I will show you its output see I will reload it as soon as I reload it, you will see here as soon as I will remove this from here, see it went up and how many seconds will it take to go from here to there, it will take 4 seconds all the time I have put there, how many seconds I have put, 3 seconds means for how much duration you want to make the transition, that is your transition duration so what did I keep, I kept 3 seconds, what will happen with transition delay as soon as the class is put, how long it will take to get seconds What will happen with transition delay?

As soon as the class is set, how long it will take to get effected As soon as I tick, it will start working after 1 second I ticked it, after 1 second it came down And it will work for 3 seconds So this is the difference between transition duration and transition delay Transition duration means how long this animation will work Transition delay means how long this animation will run Now I am using the word animation here, it does not mean that you get confused with animation property I will tell you that in the coming topics But this is an animation, but the name of the property is not animation, it is transition So we are doing this transition to transform property The transform property that is applied in this will be the transition That is, instead of going from 1 to 100 You will go from 1 to 100 easily Like you have seen that petrol is not from 1 to 500 It is a transition It is 2.33 Then 3.88 and then your petrol is added Some people add 20 rupees but it is added How much do you add? tell me in the comment section below.

Combining all Transition Properties in one:

Now what we will do is, we will move forward and learn to combine these four properties in one property now what happens is, you can combine these four properties in one property because who will write this long, who has this much time we don't write lorem 59 here, we write lorem 23, lorem 34 and lorem 45 where do we have so much time to write so many properties so there is a shorthand for this before telling you the shorthand, let me tell you that you can also do transition all by doing transition all, it will be applied to all the properties like suppose I put translate and change its background color to blue so now see that as soon as i remove this property i will remove translate class from here i removed translate class and as soon as i will put the translate class i will hide my face so i removed the translate class i removed it and hit enter as soon as i will remove the translate class see it went up and its color also changed and as soon as i will remove the translate class, it will go up and its color has also changed and as soon as I put the translate class.

I will hit enter, so see after one second it will come down and its color will change and transition will happen because I am also transitioning the color property.

Transition on Multiple Properties:

Now suppose I want to transition two properties so I can use comma separated values so instead of saying all

I can say, do the color transition and with that transform so doing this will also do my work, so I had to do color and background color

I will say, do background color and transform so if you come here and do this work again, remove the translate class from here so as you remove it, see after 1 second it went up so you can make transition of only 2 properties but you can use all if you want to make transition of all properties you can also use transformer multiple as I have already told you if you want to scale it so if I say here scale and I say 2 so it will also increase so you see it has become big and if I remove this class from this, the translate one let's say I translate it, so this class is not there, so it will go up again, it has become small then it will become big, it will come down, so if I translate the translate.

Timing Function:

So this class is applied after a second, it will come down like this, okay now I will tell you about the timing function, so see the timing function function is like this your dev tool is a good friend of mine so transition timing function is linear what does linear mean? it goes from here to here it grows then you have ease in out 
what is ease in out? and if you see below it is written this is ease in out and if you see here it is easy in out, it works like this you can make your own function by the way and how will the animation work, it looks like this this animation will run like this, the speed will increase then it will become constant, so see this animation will run like this, if you want it to run like this then it will run like this, if you want it to run like this then it will run like this if you want it to run like this then it will grow and slow down first the speed will increase suddenly then it will saturate and stop so if you do like this then it will become like this it will become like this it will come very fast then it will stop slowly so you can see its traces and you can make your own if you want to use this function after making copy this copy and bring it here.

Where I wrote ease in out, bring it there. So this is cubic bezier function. Don't remember this function, don't remember 0.2, 2, 4, 3. Make it yourself, there are other tools to make it, but according to me, if you are doing web development, then this is the best tool. If someone does editing, then you know that this is also available in Premiere Pro. When you use scale or when you try to make smooth animations, then you can do this by right-clicking in your keyframes.

You can select Temporal Interpolation, Ease In Out, all these options are there. But we will see Premiere Pro some other time. Now we are looking at CSS. So here, see, Ease Out is such a function. This is how Ease Out will work. See, this is how it will work, so here EaseOut function is there, this is how EaseOut will work, I have ruined it, but this is how it will work, this is our FastOut, LinearIn, and here this is EaseIn, see there are many other functions, this is EaseIn, this is Sine, this is InQuadratic, see there are many functions, which one do you want, you can take that, copy and paste it, use it, as simple as that so in total this is the transition, nothing more than this

Shorthand Property:

But let me tell you one more thing, shorthand property which makes all these four equal, as I told you that we are lazy people we don't have that much time, so you write transition here and after this write all these four properties that I want to do all the properties for 3 seconds

I want to do ease in out or I want to do ease in let's do ease in out and delay of 1 second so these 4 properties are set after that if you want help then click on MDN reference and you will go to its MDN reference and here in MDN reference you will get to see all this with comment you will get to see syntax so syntax is never my priority

I understand the concept and coming here directly from VS code makes me feel good because you come to official documentation and see things so here you can see that it is working if I show you my page so if I translate it then after one second it will go up and if I translate it then after 1 second it will go up and if I translate it again then it will go up for 1 second and it will work for 3 seconds, everything is working easy note is also working, let's change this function let's make it a little aggressive, it will go very fast and then slow

I will make it like this, it will go very fast and then slow it will go very fast and then it will slow down I make it like this it will go fast and then it will slow down it will go fast and then it will slow down so I take this function and copy it so the cubic bezier function

I made it, I keep it in the place of ease in out and I reload the page and I translate it again and you see how aggressive it started and then it slowed down and if I translate it again it will take an aggressive start and then it will slow down so you can make such functions so make any function you like from here and take its cubic bezier equivalent and bring it here your work will be done that was all about transition property.
