Exercise 4 - Multi Color Website

So what you have to do in this exercise

I tell you that you have to design a navbar

And after designing a navbar

You have to make a style sheet in which I will change a variable and according to those variables the color of your color will change that is, you have to make a multicolored navbar and you can do this simply by using CSS variables

I have told you about CSS variables in video no. 30 [Reference]

So you have to make this multi-colour navbar using the concepts that I have told you in video no. 30

I also want to tell you that we will gradually transition to make a full website

There are some important concepts after covering them

Like we have flexbox, grid, transitions and animations, we will make full on websites.

So many people are waiting for full on websites to be made.

So their wait is going to be over very soon.
