Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML

Shortcut:
=>click on shift right and open with code
=>I clicked on windows, shift and s
 this is a shortcut for snipping tool

Image:

now there is an img tag in html
as soon as you put img it, src and alt
both are required attributes
 img --> image tag
 infact if you don't write alt, it's ok, but it's recommended

 Q: Where is the alt?

I will tell you
see the alt is not visible
suppose for some reason server is not able to show you the image
suppose i wrote image2
now image2.png file here So what will be the error?
What will happen? I'll show you what will happen
So here the alt will be displayed
And this kind of error image will be displayed
Which will tell that the image you have put
Put it properly, you have done something wrong
The URL of the server you have given there is not this image
Okay, these things are shown like this
And there is an alt there
So the user knows what understand the purpose of this image
and if I come back here, you can see the alt text
if I don't put the alt text, then what will happen
if I don't put the alt text, then the alt text will not come
so you don't want the user to see this image when you have an error
you want the user to see this image
the user should see this image
I hope you understood this

so the image is very straight forward
it has two more attributes which are very important
one is width and other one is height 
width & height in pixels

now if you want the height to be 230 and the width to be automatically adjusted
then you just use the height attribute
now remove the width here
so the height will be 230 pixels and the more it can go in the width, the more it will go
it will be automatically adjust

you don't need to write px in this
When we write width in css, we will see that we need to write px
Here we just write width is equal to number in double quotes


now what happens is, width and height can be adjusted through CSS
and we will see in the CSS section
that why we should always set this width and height
we should always set one thing from width and height
such that when our page is loading
then our image inside the page
should not come suddenly in the page
I will tell you in the coming videos
but now you understand that
these attributes of width and height
I have heard many people saying that
they are deprecated and should not be used.

But I say that they should be used for SEO purpose.
Why should they be used? I will tell you
in the coming videos where I will tell you about
Core Web Vitals and SEO.

For now, you understand that width gives width to the image
and height gives height to the image. If one of the two is applied
then the other one automatically gets set.

Table:
table tag is very useful in html

tr --> Table row
th --> Table heading
td --> Table Data

now row span and col span are attributes, now you see here that row span means how many rows will span your td

for example, let us say I write here, I want sam and programmer, earlier they were taking one cell,
sam was taking one cell and programmer was taking one cell, I want to write sam in two cells I don't want to write programmer, I just want to write sam
I want to write here that call span is equal to 2
call span is equal to 2 means that sam will take place of two columns
what does it mean?
sam will take place of two columns
means sam will be seen like this
I will show you
like this
so it took place of this whole column

Horizontal merged cell --> colspan
Vertically merged cell --> rowspan

Used with td --> table data tag 

in html, in html table
we can also add captions
and to add captions we can use
caption tag like this tag I will show you
If we use the caption
Student details or employee details

Now you can change the font size
By default, it looks like this

Along with that You can also give header and footer But for now, by default, 
it looks like this, the caption comes up, you will see the employee details like this.
Along with that, you can also give header and footer.
You can give T-head and T-foot here.

Now I will tell you about another tag,
which is called BR tag, which adds line break

now what is the benefit of doing this, we have just grouped it
so that we can target it ahead of CSS
so you will use this very less but you can do grouping like this
Your whole table, head content will come here, foot content will come here
And body content comes in between head and foot but you can write it here
But ideally head, body and then foot comes
I hope you understood this

List:
List is very important in HTML
Because we will use list a lot
There are three types of list in HTML
1) Ordered list
2) Unordered list
3) Definition list
The most used is unordered and ordered list

Unordered list:
<ul></ul>
bullet point form

you can customize its bullet points
by using "type" attribute
square
circle
disc (default bullet style)

Ordered list:
<ol></ol>
numbered point form
->You can do this 1, 2, 3 in ABC
->You can do it in capital ABC, you can do it in roman numbers
->You can do it with the help of CSS
->There are many other ways
type=I Uppercase Roman Numerals
type=i lowercase Roman Numerals
type=1 Arabic Numerals (This is the default if the type attribute is not specified.)
type=A Uppercase Alphabetical Letters
type=a lowercase Alphabetical Letters

Definition list:
Definition list is very less used
dl --> definition list
dt --> definition term
dd --> definition of the definition

you can also change it with css, it is very less used

interviewer asks what is definition list
so this kind of code is previewed like this
I am not showing you by writing it for the sake of time
but try it out
