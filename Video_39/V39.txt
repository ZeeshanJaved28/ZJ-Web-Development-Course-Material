CSS Grid - Ultimate MasterClass

After watching this video, you will get to know about CSS Grid. I can guarantee you that. Because in this video, I have explained CSS Grid in a very easy way. And you won't be able to forget CSS Grid even if you want to, after seeing the examples I will be using. CSS Grid is used to make layouts. This is one of the ways to make layouts in CSS. Because floats and positioning are very confusing. And there are some scenarios in which CSS Grid is directly applied. How to use it, what are the properties, what is easy and what is difficult I will make it easy for you.

So CSS Grid is used to make layouts which resemble a grid. 

Q: Why CSS Grid?

Display grid, this container, then like a flex box, if I flex the display in it, then all the items get laid horizontally. This does not happen at all in the grid. You see, by doing grid, things are exactly the same. But if I inspect here, then my browser will show it as a grid. See, it is showing a grid here. And I clicked on the grid, so it is showing me. It is saying, brother, this is your grid. And there are rows in it, there are no columns in it. So the first property and when I clicked on grid, it is showing me that this is your grid and this has rows and this has no columns. So the first property that I want to tell you about grid is that you can define in grid how many columns and rows there are and some properties are such that you can put in the item. So I can write here grid template columns and I can

grid-template-columns property:

write here that I want a 120 pixel column and I want a 100 pixel column. That's about it I just need these two columns and you can see that I want a 120px column and a 100px column that's about it, I just need these two columns and you can see here that my grid will be divided into two columns I have one column here, I will zoom in and show you

I have one column here and one column here you can see here that I have toggled the grid and it has divided into two columns see this is one, this is the second line of the grid and this is the third line of the grid and this is one, this is two, this is three, this is second line of grid and this is third line of grid and this is one, this is two, this is three and this is third line of grid now in this grid, see what is special about this grid in this grid, i can place any item anywhere anywhere, if i want i can make it overlap i can place it on two, i can do that too how? i will tell you that only, so first of all we said that there will has two columns one is 120px and one is 100px so it has made 120px and 100px columns before I can visualize

I'll show you that our grid is like this I said that my grid has two columns one is of 100px one is of 120px and the grid one is of 100 pixels one is of 120 pixels and the other column is of 100 pixels ok something like this so one is of 120 pixels and the other is of 100 pixels and here I have made the 100 pixels bigger but you got the point that one is of 120 pixels and the other is of 100 pixels ok or if I make it of 190 pixels so i have created two columns 120px and 190px and now i will put any item so first item will come here second item will come here third item will come here automatically all these things will be there this is auto, i don't need to configure rows but i can say something like i can put that i can place my item in this way so that it starts here and ends here so that it starts here and ends here so that it starts here and ends here so in this way items are placed in grid so in total i want to tell you this Before we move ahead and i explain you all these things

Grid Line and Grid Cell:

I want to tell you some things First concept is grid line and grid cell Once we divide the grid, then we see this line This line, this line This line, this line, this line, this line These are called grid lines. And line and grid cell is if you have used msxl then you know that a box is a cell in our grid so a box in our grid is a cell so this area is a cell i hope you understood what is grid cell.

Grid Track and Grid Area

After this comes the concept of grid track and grid area grid track is space between two grid lines if i take two grid lines then the space will be a grid track this is also a grid track and if i take this two lines then the space between these two will be a grid track and after this comes the grid area which is the area inside the grid if i take two lines horizontal and two lines vertical the area between them is called grid area so this is the basic terminology of grid okay, I hope you guys understood now what happens is when I have set grid template columns here or I have set grid template rows so I can say that my this spacing is 10 pixels, this spacing is 20 pixels, this distance is auto, this distance is so I can define this spacing to be 10px this spacing to be 20px this distance to be auto I can define it like this, this distance to be 20px this distance to be 10px, similarly I can also define this distance to be grid template rows

I can define grid template rows to be 2 or 3 one is this row which is 25% and one of them is this row, which is 25% and the other one is this row, which automatically takes the height, then what I can do if I get a new item, then I can say that keep this item here, in this cell

I can bring one more item, I can say that keep it here and the items will overlap so I can do it like this, I can say that them to keep it here and the items will overlap so I can do it this way I can tell them to keep a given item in a way that it comes in these cells you understand and I can tell them to keep another item which comes here and I can tell them to keep another item which comes here by spanning so many cells

I will tell you how to do all these things but before that I will tell you one more thing the grid you are seeing on your screen that grid has numbers one is my first line, one is my second line one is my third, one is my fourth, fifth and sixth line I am talking about our vertical lines this is the number of these lines then there is also a number of horizontal lines this is my line number one, this is my horizontal line number two this is three and this is four, this is my horizontal line number 3 and this is my horizontal line number 4 I can also give it reverse numbering Like this 4 automatically becomes minus 1

This line automatically becomes minus 2 That is, two numbers from behind Minus 3 means three numbers from behind Minus 4 means four numbers from behind So whether I say minus 4 or 1, I am talking about this line Why is this important, I will tell you later You will know why we gave these lines numbers In the grid, we can also give these lines names I am talking about this line Why is it important? I will tell you later In grid we can give names to these lines I am telling you patiently You will understand the grid In fact, I will tell you the whole grid Because according to me, it is very useful We can give a name to this line Line number 1 is a name this is the first line in row this is the second line, third line, fourth line so i can give a name to this line, row 1 start row 1 end, third line, last line i can give a name like this, i can give a name like this, first i can give a name like this, line 2 i can give a name line 2, I gave it first, I can give this line 2, I can give this line 3, I can give this line call 4 start, I can give this line 5, and I can give this line end

I have given this name from my side, sometimes it is convenient to give name, we keep name from our side, it is convenient, I see any unknown person, like I went to get Aadhar card made once, I met an unknown person, I kept his name Vikrant, I kept it, it is convenient for me, at it I can say that Vikrant is sitting but I don't know the name, so what should I do you can see here that you can name it in this way, so this is our grid template rows and grid template columns now you guys come here in the computer screen so here we apply the theory that we have studied so I have made the grid template columns 120 and 100 pixels and you can see here one is of 120 pixels and one is of 100 pixels. Then I can say that I also need 3 rows here and I want to decide the height of my 3 rows. So I can say grid template rows and I can say 100 pixels, 100 pixels, 100 pixels here. That means I am saying that its height will be 100 pixels, 100 pixels, 100 pixels.

And you can see here if i activate grid so you can see here this is our 120px this is 100px this is 100px and this is 100px ok i can increase this height 1 and 2 are the line numbers which you can see in your screen you can see 1,2,3 are written and see here are numbers in minus from below minus 1, minus 2, minus 3 are also written these numbers are very useful so I have done this now I want my item number 4 to come here where 1 is so I will put class in this item number 4 item 4 and I will put some properties in this item 4 and I will adjust it in this I can put grid row property and grid column property I can say that grid row property and a grid column property. I can say that its grid row should start from 1 and go to 2.

grid-row and grid-column properties:

And its column should start from 1 and go to 2. Now you can see that it came here where it was. Now you can see that the item with 4 came there where my item with 1 was. But now a very strange thing happened. The item with 1 automatically pushed it out. So I can do one thing. I can say that I want the thing happened the item 1 automatically pushed it out so i can do one thing i can say i want the same thing in item 1 so i can say in item 1 that i want the same thing and i will put item 1 class here you can see the overlapping 1 and 4 are same so one above the other as you can see item 1 is same and 4 is same so i can place items in grid by overlapping so this is our grid, as I click on grid see I can see my grid and you can see my numbers are coming

I hope so far it is clear to everyone that first we have to put display grid then we have to put grid template columns and grid template rows this will tell us how many columns and rows will be made items will be placed automatically by default but if you have said in any item that I want this grid from row 1 to row 2 and this column from 1 to 2 then it will set itself in the corresponding row line and column line now here you see that I have written grid row 1 slash 2 that means row starts from 1 and comes till 2 that means here if i show you my grid then it comes on line number 1 and 2 that means it gets space from here to here it gets space from here to here in column but i can also say that it gets space from 1 to 3 which will take this space if I show you this item by hovering it, it came till here because I have set its width and height so it is not stretching completely but if I don't set its width I am just showing you here if I don't set its width and I will say that item 1 will not be from 1 to 2 it will be from 1 to 3 in column so see it has stretched itself, now I am showing item 1, it is taking columns from 1 to 3 and it is taking rows from 1 to 2 so whatever I say it will do, if I say it will take from 1 to 2 then it will take from 1 to 2 and if I say it will take from 1 to 5 then it will take space from 1 to 5 in row or column ok we can set this 1 and 2 in different properties how will we do it I wrote grid row 1 slash 2

I could have written this too grid row start and I would have made grid row start 1 and I would have made grid row end 2 so if I don't write this and write this too then also or you can do this same thing means that you can do this means you can do this or you can do this, it's the same so if i show you like this our grid is looking the same because these two lines and this is the same, this is shorthand same you can do with column, grid column start, grid column end and this one is for writing this is shorthand you can do the same with column you can place items anywhere in the grid if i want to span the 1 item i can do that if i want to span the 3 item i can do that if i can write name instead of number Because I have shown you earlier That you can write name also, so how do you write name So you can write name like this

Naming Grid lines:

You can say First, I have given this name Then I said I need 120px space Then I say second Means I have given the name of my second vertical line Second Because I am talking about columns here And if I show you I have given the name of the second line because I am talking about columns and if I show you, I have given the name of the first line and the second line I can give the name of the third line or I can just give the name of the T column now I can say that my grid column should go from 1 to T or I can say that from 1 to T where should it go? or I can say from 2nd to T so I can do like this and if I show you it will go from 2nd to T infact I have done this to item 4 from 2nd to T so if I do it on item 4 it will go from 2nd to T it means it is starting from 2nd and going to T 2nd line was this it was taking 100px space and now it is going to T if i change 2nd to 1st then it will take the whole width if i show you item 4 so it is going from 1st to 3rd and what happened because it is taking goes from 1st to 3rd And what happened is It is taking space from 1st to 3rd If I remove the width

It is taking space from 1st to 3rd That's why the 2nd item was pushed down I hope you understood this grid So this is one way to place items in grid If you know only this much As I told you Then you can use CSS Grid Up Giving name is secondary You just do 120px but if you know only this much then you can use CSS Grid-Up naming and all these are secondary things you just do 120px or 100px and if you want to declare column like this then do it otherwise automatically it becomes rows if you have declared columns then no problem if you have declared rows then no problem if I let it be like this then what will happen three rows will be made because I have declared rows and after these three rows, columns will be automatically made so it automatically figured out that if there are three rows then I will have to make two columns according to these items so if you set one thing from these two, then the other thing becomes automatic after this, you can set any item by making a grid row grid column you can make it overlap wherever you want you can do it as you want so this make it overlap you can do whatever you want but let me tell you some more things so this is one way to use grid so i can say that this is one way now i will tell you another way to use it and i will make a new file i will name it grid2 so that you can know that i want to divide it into two parts

I will tell you why I want to divide it I will take the same thing and name it as grade 1 and why I am doing this there is no concept of grade 1 and grade 2 but why I am doing this because I want you to understand what are the two ways to place it in grade so till now whatever we have read, we have given the names of the lines we have said that this is the first line, this is the second line, this is the third line, this is call for start, I can give any name I want. I had given in Hindi too,

I had shown you the first, second, third. Or we can say this is 1, this is 2, this is 3, we can say that we have done 1 slash 3. So it means that it has got this much space.

Then we said, let's say I put a number here too, 1, 2, 3, 4, then we said 3 slash 4, we put a number here 1,2,3,4 then we said 3 slash 4 we wrote 1 slash 3 in the rows and 3 slash 4 in the columns so it means that automatically it got this area ok, any item ok, now the second way I am going to tell you

Grid Template Area:

That is how you can name and keep the items so we have seen this grid column row place the item like this now one more way which I said is grid 2 what is the second way what you do is give the name of the area what you do is give display grid to any container what you will do first is give display grid then you will say that this grid in this the name of this area is navigation bar what is the name of this area, navigation bar this is called navigation bar is this area called navigation bar? this is my navigation bar this is my main content what is this? this is my empty this is my sidebar this is my footer I have divided it, how will I divide it? it has a syntax, you can say that my first column is navigation bar suppose I wrote nav then I will say nav, then I wrote nav, then I will say nav So in a way I said that this, this, this is nav, this and this is main content this is empty, this is sidebar, this, this, this is footer Now I can use these names and place the items, so see how they do it To do that what I will do, here my grid 2

I will keep display grid but i will remove the syntax which is written in item 4 and item 1 and now i will use the syntax which is grid area syntax, so earlier i wrote grid template rows, now i will write grid template areas and i will say that my grid template area is nav nav nav or i will write nav nav because i want to make only 2 columns or i will make 3 columns this time i will say nav nav nav and after nav nav nav my second one what will it be, it will be site and one more will be let's say col i have named it now see here i will preview it i renamed the file so i wrote display grid i have told here that in grid template area you can place items like this and i will place article here then i will say in item 1 grid area is nav, this is side, this is article and i will also put article here then i will say that my item 1 in that grid area is nav grid area is nav so now you see what happened here and i will remove the width of this so that you can understand that how much width it is taking now see my 1 is here in nav means my 1 item this item is in nav so these 3 were nav so it so it took up the whole space then after this, the next one I wrote here is side so my item 2 will be I will say that my item 2 will be, I will arrange it a little

I will write it properly, because you have to give the code properly so I will bring it up a little item 1, then I will do item 2, then 3, then 4 and now see here i have put grid area now i will put grid area here what should i do in grid area i will put it on side i will say this will come on side then this will come in article this will come in my article i will put grid area in article and then the next item i will put grid area article and then the next item I want to make the grid area footer footer footer footer means this is the whole footer below so I will say that item 4 is footer grid area footer you can see here I have written grid area footer so here if I show you so see one is here now if I give different colors of item item 2, 3 let's say i give background color of this, this, this, background color of this something else, let's say i give this, no i have already done this let's say i give background color of this, let's say i give background color of this, let's say azure so you see it came here then i didn't write item 2 i didn't put item 2 item 2 class and item 3 class item 4 came here and item 5 so all items are here item 1, item 2 item 3 is here because I wrote here that if I activate the grid then you can see the grid nav nav nav, first item took the nav, after this what was it, it was article whatever name I gave, second took that, then here I wrote both the same

I wrote side side, I don't know what article I wrote, I wrote both the same but I wrote article article, so them So they took article article So item 3 is in these two cells I hope it is clear Then I wrote footer footer footer So fourth one took all the space Fifth item is left so he has no other option He took the next row He said that this is the only place left if i insist that 5 should also come in the header let's say i do something like this i want to make 5 overlap here so i can use it in conjunction with let me show you the complex use case i can say item 5 If I make its grid area as nav

Then you can see the navigation bar This is also there in nav You can make it overlap So this is all in CSS grid I think you need to learn more in CSS grid I will talk about one unit which is very important If you need to learn more about CSS Grid Then you can learn more about it. I will talk about one unit which is very important Which is FR unit. So if I show you here, then you can see my grid items. I was using pixels here. But if I want my container to be 80vw Means it is taking 80% of the width of the viewport. Now I can say that if we make 3 pieces of width

fr Unit:

Then 1fr 1fr 1fr, so what does it mean I want to make columns according to this, suppose I want to do something like this

I want to say that see my grid template columns, make my columns that 1fr 1fr 1fr, fr is a unit which is specifically specifically in grid and fr means that the available width is 1 fraction 1 fraction 1 fraction, if you write 3 times then it will be 1 third if you write 4 times then it will be 1 fourth so divide it in 3 parts if i write 1fr 3 times let me show you let me show you by activating grid let me remove width so 1fr, 1fr, 1fr now why is 5 and 4 coming here why is 5 and 4 coming here because i have put some classes here which I will comment out for now I will comment out this one too and this one too you guys must have understood the concept so now here 1fr 1fr 1fr 3 columns are made if I make it 1fr 2fr 1fr and I do like this 1fr 2fr 1fr so it will take its width that this cell will be the second column it will be of double width 1fr, 2fr, 1fr can you see it? it is double of 2fr and 1fr it will set it accordingly so you can do it like this so this is the use of fr units you can use it on row instead of column it is totally up to you and one more property which I want to tell you is gap, so you can make a gap if i make 34px gap then it will be 34px.

Gap Property:

Row gap and column gap you can set it differently so you can make row gap like this suppose i want row gap to be 10px but i want column gap to be 44px so column gap will be more and row gap will be less so i can do it like this so you can see row gap and column gap will be less so i can do like this so i have taken more column gap so gap will be between items, don't use padding in flexbox or use gap in grid and another benefit of using gap is you don't get padding here you don't get spacing here now one more important thing about grid and that is if you want to justify align items so this is the benefit now after this, I will tell you one more thing about grid important thing here and that is if you want to justify align items for which I will put the width again I removed the width from here.

I will make the width again 55 pixels ok so you see all these items are like this now I want this to be center in the grid so what can I do here justify item center so see as soon as I wrote justify item center the items inside it became center in their own cell then I can write here align item center so as soon as i wrote justify item center, the items in it got centered in their own cell then i can write here align item center now see the center of the item is not because i have not given any height if i give height so my container is 50vh so my container is 50vh so now see i have given 50vh and if I write here align item.

align-items & justify-items:

center, I am seeing that why this height is not coming properly, I will make it little bigger
I will make it 100vh and if I align items here, so all the items are aligned in the center of their own cell, so I will make it 100vh so that you can understand the height is 100vh and the justify items was a center align items was a center so these align items will be center now if you want that center is not aligned and it is here and there so you can see the properties one is flex end and the other is flex start so you can do it accordingly and try all these properties if you do end then it will come in the end if you do left sorry if you do start then it will come in the start and if you do stretch then it will stretch if the default setting is set so doesn't have height width then you can use all these end, center and start you can use flex end also but don't use flex end use end only, so i hope you understood how it works now you can apply this property on individual item see what i have done here suppose i want to center this item or if i want to center item 2 or if i want to align self on this item, start, so see this item is in start if i want only one item to take itself in start so this item is in start similarly, i can use align self and justify self so in justify self I have ended it self so what I will do in justify self I have ended it so it is justified at the end this property is appearing inside the individual cell ok, keep in mind that this property is appearing inside the individual cell means if I am saying start end that box which you can see above which has 2 inside it it is appearing within that box vertical center, horizontal center, start, end it will do everything within this box flexbox will do within flexbox and here it will do within its cell so you can do it like this and one more thing i want to tell you is sometimes you have to make many columns like if i want to repeat 1fr 5 times.

repeat syntax:

So i can use repeat function i can say repeat 1fr 4 times so it will repeat 1fr 4 times so here it will repeat 1fr 4 times so you will get 4 columns i hope this is clear to you there is a min max property minimum should be 100 pixels which is the width of my cell and maximum should be 1fr so it means and maximum is 1fr ok so now see minimum is 100 and maximum is 1fr which is calculated by dividing this width into 4 parts 1fr width will depend on how many times fr is written so minimum is this much it will depend on how many times the fr is written so according to that the width will come minimum means minimum it will keep this much and after that maximum it will do 1fr this minmax function you can use anywhere, it is very useful now a confusion which happens in many people that justify items we have used, why we have not used content now I will tell you when we will use content

I have given black color border in grid You can see in grid container I have given black color border and I have used 1fr But what if I use only 40px I will do one thing I will comment 1fr So that you can get the code Now I will it 40px so when i am making it 40px.

justify-content & align-content:

so i have said that my column width should be 40px and i will remove min max 40px 40px 4 times and now see this grid is out why it is out, i will show you my container is starting from here my items are starting from here container is here and container is big, I made it 44px

I will make it 60px or 80px see here my container is big and items are taking less space if i want to align items within the container means the whole grid, not items but the whole grid if i want to align within the container then i will use justify content, if i do center then whole grid center if i do end then whole grid end and if i do start which is default then whole grid start this will only be applicable when when our container is big and the grid is small and same thing can be done vertically now see here the items are given in this way that their width is like this if I make their height like this I will say that the grid to grid template columns sorry rows and change the height to 40px and let me see how many rows are being created I want 2 rows so I will repeat it twice

I will say give me 2 rows and now you can see that the height of the container is more and the height of the grid is more the height of the grid is less so you can put here align content and align content will come in the center and will come in the end so you can do this if you want to do within the cell then you use items justify items align items will be used in the cell and if your container is big and grid is small then what you will do you will use align content justify content I hope you understood it then there is place content and place items let me show you place content center, so justify content will be center align content will be center and line content will be center so place content works like this i hope you all have understood.
