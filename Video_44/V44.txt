Exercise 7 - Design the Grid

Today's exercise will test your CSS Grid skills. I will give you an exercise in which you have to apply your CSS Grid skills and make a layout.

Exercise number 7 Which is going to be our You have to design the lower part of the ultra edit website.

Now what you have to do is make this by using the CSS grid Now I want to. Now the catch here is that I want to tell you that first download UltraEdit and the downloaded file you have to serve it right from your computer.

Now if you are in Windows like me then you have to click on download 32 bit and as soon as you click on download 32 bit this UltraEdit will be downloaded and as soon as it is downloaded

I will do one thing, I will place it in my folder so I have cut it from my download and brought it here and the name of this file is ue-english so I just want to tell you that if I write here ahref="ue-english.exe and write here download-ultraedit download-ue and if I show you this website so you see that as soon as I click on download-ue, it will be downloaded and this time the download will come from here So on your server, that is, your computer, what am I saying on the server, when you run your local website, then your server is your local computer So in your local computer, there should be a file named ue-english.exe and you will serve it from here

That means the links you are going to use, these links should come from here, that is, as soon as you click on this link from here means when you click on this link then it will be downloaded so you have to use this link use all these links for the sake of convenience and you have to design it from css grid so you have to design it from css grid and on your desktop you should see 3 columns and in your phone phone should have 1 column so if I see here how ultra edit does this so I guess here also if you come to the phone, you can see 1 column and if you do it like this, you can see 3 columns so you have to simply do this, you have to design this much portion from the CSS grid we had designed the nav bar in our last video in the last exercise, you can copy it from there simply copy it, bring the navbar here, if you design this portion too, then you will like it a lot but I don't keep this portion as an exercise part, you can directly start from here too, that is, you can delete this portion completely, and by the way, I will tell you one thing, if you inspect here, and let's say this is our portion of this website, which is this, see, it is highlighted above, I will press delete here, this is highlighted, i will select and delete it so it will be deleted here so if i show you so see here, i will reload it and show you again this portion which has download ultra edit, this is that portion this portion pb row, this is that portion so if i select this and click on delete, it will be, so you can make it in this format and all these links, even if the languages are different, but still you can use the same link and you use different links, you download different versions and put all the links, then it is a special shoutout to you, but again I want to teach you CSS Grid here, and that's why I want you to download it once and put the same link.

You can do that, but one thing is that you should be served by your local computer. You have to take care of this a little bit here. So all of you will get a shoutout, whoever will solve it, I will give a shoutout to everyone.
