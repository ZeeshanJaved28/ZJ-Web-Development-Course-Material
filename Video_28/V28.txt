CSS Position Property
In CSS, there is a very important property called Position.

Suppose you want to move an element from its previous position, then you can use position relative to create a top 3 pixel and that 3 pixel will come down. Similarly, by using position property and z-index, you can keep the elements on top of each other.

Shortcut:
div.box*5

Static Position:

Universal Selector
*{
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        /* CSS Reset */
    }

Now what is by default That the position of all the boxes is static Position is a property in CSS boxes now by default what happens is position of all 4 boxes is static position is a property in CSS which is by default static and static position means that on this top, bottom left, right, z-index all these can't be written now you will ask what is this top, bottom left, right, now see if I put top 2 pixels on it ok, so here chrome is saying to me, see position static property prevents top from having an effect let's say I put 2 pixels on top, ok so chrome is telling me that position static property prevents top from having an effect if you keep any position other than static then you can enjoy this property so how to enjoy this property this is what I want to tell you so see, if I don't use position property in this means by default its position should be static so what will be the behavior of the position static? First the top box will come, then the bottom box, then the top box, then the bottom box, and then the last box Typical CSS behavior which I will expect Let's say I put the absolute position in the bottom box So this is position static, I hope you understood what it is Position static means that it will stay where it was No effect will be there, now after this there is an absolute position.

Relative Position:

There is a relative, before absolute I will tell you relative What is relative positioning, now assume that I say box 2 Make the position relative, Relative means that the one who had his own place  relative means not relative other elements will not matter I can move this element from its place so if I want it to go up and if I want it to go to the left I say left 34px so from left to here 34px distance will come and I will increase it as much as I want so what happened is it got stack up on this box which is our cn box it got stack up on this its color is not cn it, its color is not CN, its color is Aqua, so it is on the Aqua box, now suppose for some reason you want that my Aqua box should not be on the bottom, my Aqua box should be on the top and this box should be on the back, so we can set the value of Z-index, if I set the value of Z-index here I do anything here, it will not make any difference so what I have to do is I have to put position relative here then z index will work I will come back to this later

Why did we put position relative here but as soon as I give it position relative I can set its z index if I give it 1 it should not be 0, it should be 1 if it has more than this z index then it will come up now position relative we have put it because whenever you want to use z index, then you have to remove the static from position property and give some position, ok this is the rule to set z index here we have not used top bottom so it will not make any difference just its position will be set and its position is set means there is another position a new position is added because of which I can put z-index on it, if I remove z-index then it will go back so static position is by default property, you know this position static will be seen in your css, yes sometimes we use it

suppose I want to reset its position, I want it to be relative so reset it when a media query comes that is, whenever we resize, I will tell you in the coming topics but just I want to tell you that position static
we sometimes write javascript and set it but forgetting all those things, we come to the point we saw position static, we saw position relative you can use top, bottom, left, right if you have set position relative so if I reload it, nothing will happen because all these CSS we were writing here which goes away after refreshing so here I will quickly write top 34 pixels and bottom let us say 56 pixels and you see from top and in fact not bottom, I have to write left here left or right, either I will set top or bottom, I will do one of these. So here you see top 34 pixels, left 56 pixels, you see I have given from top and left. So I hope you understood this thing. 

If I want to set the z-index of other boxes, then I have to put position in it. But now I let it be like this, so it came on top of it, you can see the box. So this was the position.

Position Absolute:

Now I want to tell you what happens by doing position absolute so first of all i will give a parent to all the boxes so all these will come under a parent div so here i have given a class parent div let us say i want to write some styles in this parent div and i want to give some styles here dot parent and I want to give some padding here let us say 3 pixels and margin 

let us say 34 pixels and I will make it 43 pixels and here I will give border 2 pixels solid purple ok, let us keep this much for now and you can see
that there is a parent box in which all the other boxes are kept.

So now what I will do is I will give position to this box 1 I will give it position absolute what will happen by giving position absolute by giving position absolute it will seem that this element see I gave it position absolute it has become that this element is not there in normal document flow ok, so see this was my box 2, to which I had given relative position and I have given relative position to it, I would like to end its relative position for once just to explain to you what happens with absolute position so now you have to understand this thing that when I will absolute position of anything then what will happen, when I will absolute the position of anything then what will happen When I will absolute the position of this then what will it do, I have absolute the position of this 

Then it will not do anything, but as soon as I said absolute position top 0 pixels. Now see what it will do, it has gone to the top in viewport You can see what it will do, it will find its parent and say parent are you a positioned element Understand this carefully What did I say what did I do listen to me carefully forget everything whatever you were thinking look carefully at the screen div which is box 1 in that I gave position absolute as soon as absolute position is given and top 0 pixel is given.

Now he will try to find out who do I have to be related to 0 pixel so what will he do he will search his parent he will try to find out who is the relative of 0 pixel so what he will do, he will ask his parent, dad are you a positioned element his dad will say wait I will see, he will see that there is no such position in my class my position is static, so he will say bye dad, then he will say, who is his grandfather? body, he will say grandfather are you positioned, he will say no, then he will go to his father 
he will say but grandfather are you a positioned element? he will say that I am not positioned but I have no one above me so you can be my relative here, he will say ok so his relative will be 0 pixel from top so whose relative is this? nearest positioned ancestor nearest positioned ancestor so what is the meaning of position? that position should not be static, it should be something else.

Now you see here, if you don't understand what is the parent of this then listen again here I have made position absolute, top 0px if I will increase top, then it will come like this if I add left 0px here and I say left should also be 0px i add left 0 and i want left to be 0 so here left html relative is 0 so here you can see left is 0 now what i will do if i increase left like this so you can see it is going here because this is 144px and top 8px means this is 8 pixels from here so top 8 pixels and left 144 pixels I hope you understood what I am saying.

When I did position absolute, I will do 8 pixels from top because it has decided that it will move relative to html so top 8 pixels relative to html and here 144 pixels relative to html but what if if i would have positioned the parent i mean the parent let me document the format in the dot parent class if i put position let us say absolute i have not set the top and bottom so parent will not be pulled from anywhere but position is absolute that means the parent's position is set that's all the change has come now when he will ask papa papa are you positioned so his papa will say yes bro.

I am positioned so you can be my relative so now the box 1 is that top 0 pixel will be whose relative it will be the relative of our parent see now top 0 pixel is be relative to my parent see top 0 pixel is relative to my parent means if I increase it then it will be relative to my parent not relative to html you have seen this thing and if I put left here in this way that left becomes 3 pixels then you can see here that by doing left 3 pixels and if I increase left 3 pixels then you can see here that this is how the relative of the parent is running so the position absolute what it does is it finds its nearest parent which is positioned and once it finds its nearest positioned element its relative, that top, left or bottom, right, bottom, left whatever the set is, that it will set its position.

Fixed Position:

Now one more property is fixed ok, I will do one thing, I will reset it again and like our 4 boxes were they will come as they are, ok the position I have given in parent, I will remove that too and you guys see here that our 4 boxes came as they were now if you will also, I will remove that also and you can see here that all the boxes are same as they were now if I fix the position of this third box I mean I want to fix the position of box 3 so if I write position here and I write fixed so you can see position fixed and top or bottom bottom 0 pixels and left let us left 25 vw if i do something like this so what will happen, 25 vw is shifted now i want to show you one thing and you know what is that that thing is that it will be fixed here no matter if i scroll this page now there is not much content on this page that i can scroll it but i can always fix that by increasing the height of the box, so where the height was 133 there I will make it 433, so you see that now I am scrolling it so the box is set here, you are seeing, so I will do anything, if I want to keep such a thing here, you must have seen many such sites where if you scroll once then the ad or something else is static now I will fix it a little, I will bring it to the center so the 25bw that I had given here on the left I will reduce it a little to bring it to the center I will do something like this and I will do 8vw on the left and here I will do 8bw on the left where did you go left of box 3, here is 8bw as soon as I do 8bw where did you go left box3, here is 8bw as soon as I will make it 8vw, you can see here and if I refresh it, then it will be here irrespective of how my other website is scrolling and if I want to set its height means if I make its height 111 pixels

So you can see here I have to make it important because I have written the box below so let me do one thing, I will put the definition of box above and now see its height has changed you can see here that my box on which I have put position fixed it is fixed, so my box 3 is fixed and it is fixed according to this and I am scrolling the page so nothing is happening, I hope you understood.

Sticky Position: 

Now I will tell you about position sticky and for this I want to take a better example so I will show you one thing here, the position I put here in box 3, I will comment it out and I will make box 1 sticky and I will say that its position is sticky as soon as I will make its position sticky you will see here, I will make the position of this stick ok as soon as I make the position of this stick you can see here I will make the top 0 I will make the top 0 I have made the top 0 pixels I will make the top 0 pixels as soon as I do this, you can see it is stuck and when it comes in use, I will tell you.

Suppose our box is a nav bar ok and its height let us say 111 pixels and its width is 111 pixels and its width is 100% and its margin is 0 and padding is 0 I will also make padding 0 and you will see that by making padding 0 and margin 0 it looks like this, it is in my parent obviously but as soon as I scroll it, see everything is scrolling above it, so let's say this is my navbar of this website, I know this is not a very good navbar and we are going to make a better website than this, this is just a start, let me tell you that many people were saying in the comment that when will we make good websites, let's finish all the property, then we will make, it is such a website that you will also say that this will go up a little, we have raised it a lot and this is the target that I have taught you to make dangerous websites but I want to tell you some basics first, you see here this box, we have given a position here, sticky, sticky means something that sticks, the thing that sticks will stick on the wall, you see as soon as I scroll it sticks, and if I come here it will stay to the wall now see, as soon as I scroll it will stick ok and if I come here, it will stay like this until you scroll till here, it will not stick so until you scroll till here, it will behave like a static position but as soon as you scroll beyond it as soon as you scroll beyond it. 

You can see here position by doing sticky here, it stuck to the wall so this is position sticky, there is a lot of difference between fixed and sticky, I don't know why people say that we have confusion between fixed and sticky, according to me fixed is different, sticky is different, this is a very frequently asked question, if you go to stackoverflow, you will see that I am confused between fixed and sticky, but I don't think there is going to be a lot of confusion between fixed and sticky but I don't think that I will be too confused between fixed and sticky fixed means, it is telling the name, fix it at one place means you have taken 4 pages and pasted the box here in your screen, it is not moving from here it is stuck here fix means, fix it on the wall by screwing it remember it like this and sticky means that until you scroll above it it will remain static and as you scroll above it, it will remain static and as soon as you scroll above it, it will stick to the wall like this as you can see this is our sticky, now the position we have given is sticky. I hope you understood all four properties.

More on Positions:

And before making that comment, I will remove the position sticky and top and after removing all this, I will revert it to position absolute so when you will see box 1, then its position is absolute and this is relative to our html and as I told you that box 1 will check its parent first if it has position on it, then it will be relative to its parent as you can see, html or body is not set here, it will check the parent first if it has position on it then it will set the relative of the parent as you can see, it will not set the relative of the body it will set here.

Now if i fixed the position of it then also it will be considered as having position and you can see here it will set the relative of it if i made the position of parent sticky and the position of the child

What i did i made it absolute so that child will position himself relative to his parent like in case of box 1 we have put top 0 left 3 so top 0 left 3 will be relative to the parent because the parent is positioned now whether it is positioned with position fixed whether it is positioned with position sticky whether it is positioned with position absolute or if it is positioned by sticky, absolute or relative but there is one exception in this and it can introduce some weird bugs in your code transform, filter or perspective properties can also make an element appear as positioned ok, if I set perspective property on transform filter then it will also be considered as positioned what is the meaning of this and what is this weird thing

let me tell you, suppose I have not positioned it suppose I have not put position relative in it in its child, position is absolute listen carefully, if you are not careful then you will not understand I will give you position relative in this, suppose I have not put position relative in this there is absolute position in its child, listen carefully, if you are not paying attention then you will not understand.

I give the guarantee of this thing myself, before you say that you are not understanding because these things are very listenable, watch the video again if you want here I said that I have not used any kind of positioning in this so it will set itself as body relative or you can say html relative, the thing is the same so it will go to the top of the document according to the body relative or you can say html relative so it will automatically go to the top of the document and it will follow top 0 and left 3 pixels but if I put position relative here then what will happen then it will be parent relative but there is one more exception when it will be parent relative if I put transform property on it about which I have not told you.

I know that I have not told you put transform property on it About which I have not told you
I know that I have not told you about transform property So what I will do is I will make it translate 0.

I will tell you about translate transform property
In the coming topics, but for now you assume that this is a property If this property is there, then also see what happened This is the relative position of my parent.

So here are these three properties which very few people tell and I have not seen this thing anywhere I have felt it myself, a bug came in my code after that I saw here and there, so I did not get the answer of stack overflow. 

I got a comment, I got to know this thing in that I am telling you a long time ago and if the filter property is also applied like a filter property, filter and invert ok, let's say I put invert filter and you see here, by putting filter invert, basically color is inverted but by putting filter invert, it also, and if I put invert 0 here then I guess nothing happens, so here you see, as I put filter invert 0 so this box is related positioned as relative to its parent but if we didn't know that these three properties can also be represented as a position element then we would have been cheated and interviewers also ask this question that will you put an invert filter on your parent or any other filter and will ask you that tell me whose who will this box position itself top most HTML or this parent and if you don't know all this then it is possible that it will do HTML because it doesn't have position but it has filter so it will position itself relative to this parent I hope it is clear, you are understanding same goes for perspective property also if I set perspective property here so I have set perspective 0m and you can see here this is relative position of parent which means these three properties can also make it appear as a positioned element I hope that makes sense

For now I will remove it but these three properties you have to keep in mind I will put it up and this is an exception here, I would like to write it as an exception here, it is a very important exception and with this our position property is over, I hope you guys enjoyed it and you guys must have have said that it's fun to hear all these properties Because by using position and z-index

You can make your element appear anywhere If you want one particular element to come at the top Increase its z-index If you want one particular element to be below one and above another So you set the values of z-index accordingly That the one who has the most value in z-index It will come at the top And the one who has the most value in z index will come up and the one who has the least value will be at the bottom so play around with z index and i hope you enjoyed this course.
