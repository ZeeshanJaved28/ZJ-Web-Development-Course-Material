CSS Object-fit and Object-cover:

Today we will talk about object fit and object position properties. Sometimes we have to keep an image in a container like this such that it gets covered in its width or it gets fit by maintaining its aspect ratio in that entire container.

To do such things, we use object fit property. And I will also cover object cover property in detail in this video.

This object fit property and object position property solves a very big problem in CSS and web development.

CSS object fit and position and then we will also talk about background position

Object-fit & Object Position:

This object fit property and object position property This solves a very big problem in CSS and web development. I will show you what happens so first of all I have already made index.html on video 49 I will put a boilerplate template and I will tell you here CSS object fit and position and then we will also talk about background position so now what I will do here now I will make a container here.

I made a container, I said this is a container, I will write some styles and in the style I will write that the height of the container is 34 pixels and the width is 88 pixels. And here I will put a border, I will say border 2 pixels solid black or maybe I will put a border I will say border 2px solid black or maybe I will put a background color and this time I will put the color of your choice, no problem so this box is made, I have not done anything big

I have made only one box, so after making this box I will put an image in it and I will write here image and I will get an image so I do one thing, open image in new tab and here I have got an image which I will copy and after copying I will use img tag and put it here so that you can see what I am doing now I will show you the preview so see how it is looking so you are seeing this image is coming out of our container, why is it coming out of our container why is it coming out? because the image is big and the container is small, as simple as that there is no big rocket science in it, so what can I do? I can give width to this image

I can say, let's do one thing, it is simple, where are you taking tension? let's give width, if I want to stay inside it, let's say I give width 66 pixels and let's say I give height 88 pixels

I gave height and width as per my wish but you know what this image is not good so I am finding the aspect ratio and getting worried what will I do better than this let's say I did 466 pixels and 488 pixels now see this image is a bit not maintained, listen carefully

Q: What can I do to fix it?

Now either I find its aspect ratio that its height is this much, it is 2 is to 1 image, so if its height is 20, then I calculate its width accordingly So I don't want to read all that, I will only use one property which CSS has provided me And I respect that property very much and that is object fit property I will use only one property which is provided by CSS and that is object fit property and listen carefully because you won't understand if i write object fit i will say cover this box not this box, this width and height i am talking about this width and height I am talking about this width and height the width and height in this image cover this much position 466px and 488px cover it, because you won't be able to fit the image, so I am saying to the image look image, you are not able to fit in this box, because your aspect ratio is getting worse, so why don't you cover this box, such that your aspect ratio is maintained cover it with anything, width 466 and height 488 so here you can see that this much portion has been covered by maintaining the aspect ratio now how will I know that it has covered this much aspect ratio so let me do one thing, the width and height of the parent is also same, see there is no meaning of parent, what width and height

I have given in this container here the width and height I have given will be covered, you understand means by covering object width it will only see its height and width it doesn't care about parent's height and width but still to show you

I will make its width and height same and height 488 so 488 and now you can see it covered it, such that aspect ratio is maintained if i inspect and show you then you can see that this container it covered the container and it kept the image in such a way that it covered it if i show you this image, it is like this but it only showed this much portion of the image If i show you this image It's like this

But it only showed this much portion of the image Now if i say you cut this much portion See this much portion is cut So css will say you You only said to cover this box I had to cover this box Yes i will say you have to cut it Only then you can cut this box to cover it yes, I will say that you have to cut it only then you can cover this box ok, no problem, I will say you do one thing show the whole image and leave some space so for that we use object fit contain so if I will contain it, then in this width and height this object will contain, means this image will contain

I will see the whole and see, I can see it completely but when i have to maintain aspect ratio then from here and here, space will be left okay, so i will say i don't like this space, let's revert back to object fit cover but i will say that i like this space even if this portion would have been cut but this should not have been cut so you can tell which portion you want to show top right bottom right left bottom or you can decide which one you want to show so for that property is object position so I will say object position you do top right so when I do top right now see it showed me the top right portion and cut this part if I say bottom right so I will see bottom right this is very simple bottom is visible, right is visible and you have to cut the image to show the whole image so this is how object fit property works very simple and simple property

I hope no one has any problem and by learning about object fit and object position and object fit and object position your life will become so much easier you will see how much we will use this property when we make projects your life will become so much easier if you learn this much now I will move forward and tell you more so the by default property of object fit is fill so if I remove this and fill it fill object fit so what will remove it and fill object fit fill it, so what will happen it will look like this the width and height that I have given will be on the image so like this it will fill the whole image will be seen but distorted after this there is one property one value of object fit is

I will show you scale down, so if I scale down then it will be small, ok our image will be scale down, and most of the time our object fit is used contain and cover, fill by default if you want to reset then you can do none so it will be reset, I have put object position because of that it is looking like this but if I put scale down now

I will show you by putting scale down I will remove it so see this is how it will look

I hope you understood this and you understood object fit and object position property you can also specify in object fit property how far you want to see the image so if I don't write object position here

I will write it like this that i want 10 pixels and from here say 20 pixels so it will obey let me show you, let me cover it so if i cover it so see here it increased the distance after covering it, it took the distance if i say contain it if i say contain if I say contain then see it shifted the image accordingly ok, so you can change your object position by doing this, by using this you can easily bring the image wherever you want, ok so see you can do something like this as you want you can use the object position values here, you can also use percentage values, like I make it 50% and make it 50% so now see it will come like this and if I make the object fit here say cover so see 50% 50% means this center portion is showing me ok, I hope it is clear to everyone and we are going to use it a lot in the coming videos now I want to tell you about the background one way is to keep an image element

Background Property:

But there is another way by using this image URL we can give background to this container so I commented this and this image is not existing so I commented this, so what I will do on the container instead of giving background color

I will say that I want to give a background and background image and I will use URL and I will put it in double quotes so I will say in this container set this background now here why is alt is equal to I guess I have done something wrong I have done something wrong which is fine. Now here it is looking correct. I will put it here Now ok. So you guys see here when I will do background image url like this, it is not an element but a background is there. Now suppose I want to see center portion of this image. So I want that in this container background is there such that I can see center portion of this image. So I want to put background in this container such that I see the center part of the image or let us say top right part of the image.

So what I can do is I can use the background position property. Suppose I said top right, then I will see the top right portion. If I say 50% 50% or I can also call it center center. Center center, so now I will see the center portion without changing the aspect ratio of the image now this is not an image, this is a background sometimes people want their images not to be downloaded by inspect element, noobs can't download their images so they put a background, but that also gets downloaded from here from the background image so those who do it, do it all but I am just telling you, I've seen many people who put background so that the image doesn't get downloaded, okay?

So, I hope that, and even by right-clicking you don't get open image in new tab, when you put background so there is no option here of open image in new tab.

So, whenever you want to save the image from downloading, from noob you can't save from all, from noob if you want to save from script keys then you can save it from this. Okay from noob, if you want to save from script kitties, then you can save from this.

So this was about background, now here I told you about background position, I told you about background image, then what happens, that once if you put a small image, suppose I didn't put background position, and I put a background image like this, which is a small image, so let me give you an example of a small image

I just want a small image let me open the website, don't know which website is opening let me open this and I just want a small image open image in new tab now see they have also put a background no, this is their image, this is a small image let's copy this and if I paste it here so after pasting it here

I just want to show you that this image is repeated so this image is repeated in y, if it was small in x then it would be repeated more so background if you put it then it is by default repeated to remove this repeat property you use background repeat if you write no repeat then it will be repeat in x and y if you write repeat x if it is small if the width of background image is small then it will be repeat in x it will not be repeat in y it is not required to repeat in x it is repeating by the way if you see it carefully it is repeating but the way if you see it carefully it is repeating from here but almost its width is covered so it is not visible but it is repeating in Y so if you want it not to repeat then write no repeat, in most of the cases you will use no repeat and if you write no repeat then it will look like this and if you want it to be in the center then you can use background position center center, so see it will come in the center your background, come in the center sometimes it happens that our background image is very big and you just want to show the center part or top right part or top left part of it so you can show that by using these properties so these were some background related properties I hope you understood then we have here the background is repeated

I will tell you about the background clip so in the background clip you can either write border box or padding box let me show you what it means by going to MDN reference you will understand a little clearly so when you say that background clip is border box so this is your content if you do padding box then padding is removed and your content is there if you do content box then your content is inside this padding is not there it is not there in counting it is very less used to be honest but it is good to know and one more thing i want to say in this video that there are many properties which you will explore by yourself but what i am teaching in this course 99.9% i have told you 9.9% and through projects everything will be covered so you don't need to take tension
